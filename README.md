Customer Feedback Insights â€“ Food Industry

Customer feedback is one of the most valuable resources for innovation in the food industry. This project focuses on collecting and integrating feedback data from surveys, social media, and product reviews into Power BI to generate meaningful insights. The aim is to provide a centralized view of customer sentiment, highlight recurring complaints, and identify emerging preferences that can support product improvements and marketing strategies.

The project is implemented entirely in Power BI using data modeling and DAX measures. Feedback data from multiple sources is cleaned, structured, and unified into a single schema for analysis. Power BI dashboards are designed to classify and visualize sentiment scores across products, features, and regions. Users can track the ratio of positive, neutral, and negative feedback, and monitor sentiment changes over time.

In addition to sentiment trends, the dashboards provide product-specific insights such as comparisons between categories, performance by taste, price, and packaging, and correlation between customer satisfaction and product performance. Customer segmentation is also applied within Power BI to identify behavioral groups such as loyal customers, critics, and infrequent users, with filters available for demographics like region, age, and purchase channel.

The final strategy and innovation layer of the dashboard highlights trending keywords, recurring issues, and regional patterns in preferences. These insights allow R&D, product, and marketing teams to make data-driven decisions, create actionable strategies, and track customer response before and after product launches. Overall, this project demonstrates how Power BI and DAX can transform raw feedback data into valuable insights for growth and innovation in the food industry.
